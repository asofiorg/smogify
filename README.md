## About The Project

Under the growing uncertainty of climate change, and the threat it poses to the health of
millions of people around the world exposed to the toxic levels of air pollution, _Smogify_ is a
mobile app powered by computer vision able to identify the pollution level of public routes
based on overlaid data consisting of the visible emissions from every individual actor in traffic.
Therefore, Smogify provides an insight into the distribution of pollution within an urban
community.

In order to calculate the visible emissions, the computer vision software is fed with data from video through crowdsourcing. This service is oriented on applying Artificial Intelligence to combat climate change by tracing pollution levels in the most contaminated areas due to transportation. Given the intersection between the climate crisis and other fields, _Smogify_ yields a wide range of benefits, including improving public health in areas affected by high levels of pollution, and even adding a novel criterion for finding the best route an Uber can take to be more environmentally friendly, get additional input over potential traffic congestion and avoid potential health threats.

### The problem that needs to be solved.

In Colombia, every car must undergo a technical inspection periodically to check for excess emissions and to repair the car if necessary. However diligent this inspection might be, we have been stuck behind a public-transport bus, bewildered by its pitch-black smog way too many times not to question: ‚Äúis this even allowed?‚Äù ‚Äì it is not. What is going wrong, then?

As per _Superfreakonomics_, 1 out of every 140 miles driven are driven drunk. Likewise, ‚ÄúThere is just one arrest for every 27,000 miles driven while drunk.‚Äù This data, although from the United States, pertains to a great degree to our question: why are these deprecated vehicles still circulating? Perhaps, they are simply not being asked for their inspection certificates. After all, in Colombia, we sport not only one license plate, but two, and officers should be able to check for the revision of suspicious vehicles in an instant. The problem is how we identify a vehicle as suspicious. The human eye clearly doesn‚Äôt work for identifying drunk drivers, and we believe it doesn‚Äôt work for identifying polluting cars either. The smog is visible, but we have grown accustomed to it: currently, our only objective measure for our cars‚Äô condition is the inspection. We want to add another objective measure with the help of AI. We want to identify the smog of every individual actor in traffic through crowdsourcing and overlay the data in GPS systems. Identifying a polluting car will draw a yellow trail for as long as the user‚Äôs camera and the polluting car stay in the same route. This yellow data should get overlaid for every polluting car, getting darker as they get stacked on top of each other. This way we get an estimate of the overall pollution in a given route.

We believe we are very repetitive in the routes we take: we go to school, to our friend‚Äôs house, or to the supermarket most of the time. Public transport buses follow the same route everyday and so do cargo trucks. Thus, the routes people take tell a story about their routine, and also about their car.

Cars that frequently go through polluted regions are likely polluting themselves.

Collecting this data can be extremely valuable because it provides statistically-prone pools to check for polluting cars. We believe it can also be highly valuable to public-health officials in identifying urban areas that suffer from vehicle contamination. Last but not least, we can add a layer of intelligence to GPS software: our goal shouldn‚Äôt just be to arrive in the shortest time possible, perhaps we want to avoid cancerogenous gasses as well.
